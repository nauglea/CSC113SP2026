# AI Tool Comparison - Week 2

## Test Date: [01/22/2026]

## Tools Tested
1. Gemini 2.5 Flash
2. Claude (free)
3. ChatGPT 3.5

## Test Results

### Prompt 1: Simple Explanation Task
**Prompt**: [Explain what artificial intelligence is to someone who has never heard of it before. Keep it under 100 words.]

| Tool | Response Time | Quality | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Gemini | [medium] | [score 3/5] | [Provided examples of how AI learns material and a detailed description of AI] |
| Claude | [medium] | [score 4/5] | [Provided a description of how AI is already being used in text prediction or suggested movies] |
| ChatGPT | [medium] | [score 3/5] | [Described AI as a "helper" to analyze data and nudge computers and people to solve problems.] |

### Prompt 2: Creative Task
**Prompt**: [Write a haiku about debugging code at 2 AM.]

| Tool | Response Time | Quality | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Gemini | [fast] | [score 4/5] | [Made the user think that fixing the code was going to stop the programmer from sleeping.] |
| Claude | [fast] | [score 4/5] | [Spoke to the programmer, foregoing coffee to complete the code and the programmer was victorius.] |
| ChatGPT | [fast] | [score 4/5] | [used terminology specific to programmers -terminal instead of screen- implied the the break of day corrected the code, not the programmer.] |

### Prompt 3: Information Retrieval 
**Prompt**: [List 5 key differences between machine learning and traditional programming. Format as a comparison table.]

| Tool | Response Time | Quality | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Gemini | [medium/ slow] | [score 3/5] | [Used keywords to highlight the differences between machine learning and traditional programming. Unbiased information provided.] |
| Claude | [medium] | [score 4/5] | [Provided detailed descriptions of each aspect. Did not highlight keywords.] |
| ChatGPT | [medium/ slow] | [score 3/5] | [Did not provide explanations of terms, assuming the user understood the basics of traditional programming and machine learning tools.] |

### Prompt 4: Problem Solving
**Prompt**: [I need to learn GitHub for a college course. Create a 30-day learning plan with specific daily tasks. Keep each day under 30 minutes of work.]

| Tool | Response Time | Quality | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Gemini | [slow] | [score 4/5] | [Included descriptions of each days work and was basic enough to promote success without making the user feel stupid.] |
| Claude | [slow] | [score 4/5] | [Provided no detailed descriptions. Plan reads like a checklist but does not promote learning.] |
| ChatGPT | [slow] | [score 3/5] | [Set reasonable goals for each day. Set goals by day 30. All lessons under 30 minutes a day.] |

## Comparative Analysis
[Comparing 3 AI software opened my eyes to the differences in each. Similar to healthcare providers, users will lean toward the one that they like best. All three had decent response times to the prompts. Depending on the number of parameters provided, results came faster with broader less specific requests. Describing AI and writing a Haiku about programming yielded similar responses. 
Gemini Flash provided examples of how AI learns material, while Claude and ChatGPT explained what AI does and gave examples of how AI was already being used in life. 
When the user is trying to create a table to compare information, they should include specifics about what exactly to compare. Each service compared similar facets of machine learning vs traditional programming but they did not compare the same items. 
As a new AI user, I was surprised at the options presented after the initial request. After the 30- day plan was listed, there were suggested prompts to create a printable list for completion. The chat bot offered additional items the use may not have thought about. ]

## My Choice for Primary Tool
**Tool**: [Choice of tool would depend on what the request would be. I like Claude's creativity and the explanations provided in the table. Gemini has expanded learning plan in the prompt provided would need to compare another learning plan. I like that Gemini highlighted the keywords in the table. ChatGPT also has a place with the learning plan but I did not care for the table or creativity of ChatGPT.]  
**Reasoning**: [I guess I am not convinced that one is better than the others. I would definitely explore each of them with the same prompt and use the pieces from each that would work in my projects.]  
**Backup Plan**: [With three or more AI tools at my fingertips, I do not think that rate limits will be an issue. Learning to write smart prompts that have a focused enough request that can be narrowed in 5 or less alterations would hoefully meet my needs. If not, take a break. Sometimes you need to step away and think about what you are asking. The time reflecting on your request may click the last piece you need.]

## Week 3 Update
## What Changed Since Last Week
[I primarily used Claude for this week. I want to explore each serrvice as we go through the modules. I did ask ChatGPT to help me with prompts and ran them through Claude to produce the responses. I did not attach the  informatino of resources from the texts used in my course. When using the AI tool attached to the publisher, i have the option to select which texts to pull information from. SAGE was helpful and the slide decks were useful.]

## Rate Limit Experience
[I did hit limits with Claude. I decided that reaching the limit meant I was ready for a break. I stopped for the day because my brain was done. If I was not done for the day I would switch to ChatGPT and keep working. I use the results as a framework and perform edits and corrections. Their voices may be different even with the helper profile. ]

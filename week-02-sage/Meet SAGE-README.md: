# SAGE: My Study Assistant & Guide Engine

## What is SAGE?
SAGE is my assistant and will help me develop improved methods of course information delivery. SAGE will help organize my thoughts and promote easier understanding of difficult concepts in my class.

## How I'll Use SAGE This Semester
1. SAGE will organize material I provide into outline formats and help design slide decks for lectures. 
2. I hope to load the outlines into Notebook LM and create podcasts for my students to listen to. 
3. SAGE will also help me create quizzing checkpoints to ensure my learners are tracking the material.

## Tools I'm Using
- **Primary**: Sherpath AI - Has all of my required resources already loaded into its database.
- **Secondary**: Claude - I like the organization and easy to understand language Claude uses. I will use this as a secondary tool for slide deck creation.
- **For Special Tasks**: Canva AI may be used for smaller projects.

## Ground Rules for Working with AI
I am just getting used to using AI. I recently finished my Doctorate in Nursing and can honestly say I did not use AI for any part of my project. 
That being said, AI is a tool and I encourage using AI in the classroom. I suggest students use it to augment their writing. 
For example, when describing a medication's mechanism of action, I explain to the student to copy and paste the wording into an AI tool and ask it to simplify the wording so that the student understand the action.
I plan to use AI to summarize chapters providing specific parameters to lead by example. AI is powerful and must be used carefully as to not do all the work for me. 
I want to use AI to make my lessons better, more organized and interesting.][Write 3-5 personal guidelines for when/how you'll use AI ethically and effectively.

# CSC113SP2026
 Hi, I'm Amy Naugle

## About Me
Currently teaching NUR 213 and taking CSC-113 AI Fundamentals and learning to collaborate with AI tools!

## My Foo 🎯
I am passionate about learning new ways to engage students in nursing. I have been a nurse since 2008. I have worked in emergency medicine, hematology/oncology, cardiac services, medical/ surgical nursing and memory care Providing students with knowledge and what to expect in the nursing field is my favorite part of the job!

## Currently Learning
- 🤖 AI collaboration and prompt engineering- I want to make presentations better and more engaging in class.
- 🐙 GitHub workflows and version control- Learning this process is a challenge but I am willing to go outside my comfort zone!
- 💡 Building my first AI assistants- I need all the assistants and assistance I can get!

## Fun Fact
I am a National Champion Artistic Roller Skater. Like the ice skaters but on old school roller skates.

## Find Me

#### Week 2: AI Tools & First Collaborations
**Date**: [1/19-1/25/2026]

**What I learned this week:**
- [I learned that each AI tool has a different style and users need to be selective of which tool they want to use for which project.]
- [Prompt engineering is similar to speaking with people. It is not what you say but how you say it. You need to be specific enough without bogging down details and broad enough to gather appropriate information.]
- [AI cannot do it all. Even machines need rest breaks.]

**What challenged me:**
- [Programming language and using github. I am a nurse and an educator. I only know about programming what they show on TV. And working in healthcare, I know that what they show on TV is not the same in real-life. I am humbled by my lack of knowledge in this area and I struggle not being the content expert.]

**What I'm proud of:**
- [One of my pages worked. I am not sure how I did it but it presented pretty instead of with all the code. I guess my goal next week is to have two pages work. This is hard for me as I am an overachiever.]
**Questions I still have:**
- [Is there an AI for dummies? or remedial AI?]

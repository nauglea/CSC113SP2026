## Week 3 Update
## What Changed Since Last Week
[I primarily used Claude for this week. I want to explore each serrvice as we go through the modules. I did ask ChatGPT to help me with prompts and ran them through Claude to produce the responses. I did not attach the  informatino of resources from the texts used in my course. When using the AI tool attached to the publisher, i have the option to select which texts to pull information from. SAGE was helpful and the slide decks were useful.]

## Rate Limit Experience
[I did hit limits with Claude. I decided that reaching the limit meant I was ready for a break. I stopped for the day because my brain was done. If I was not done for the day I would switch to ChatGPT and keep working. I use the results as a framework and perform edits and corrections. Their voices may be different even with the helper profile. ]
